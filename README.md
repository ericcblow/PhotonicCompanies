# PhotonicCompanies
A database and a map of current companies working on integrated photonics within the computing and telecommunication space. This database is not all encompassing, just adding to this as I come across a company I was not aware of. There are a currently few catagories: Startups, Large Companies, Foundries, and Defense Contractors.

The goal is to gain a global perspective of what people are working on within the space and the scale of the industry. Additionally hopefully help people within the space search for job opprotunities. 

To potentially add: 
- Date Founded
- Cost-of-living
- Salary (maybe pull from glassdoor/linkedin) 

Please feel free to contribute and update the database to add companies / fix any inaccuracies. 

To currently view map open CurrentCompanyMap.html within the repository.
